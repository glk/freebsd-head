.Sh NAME
.Nm gpioiic
.Nd GPIO I2C bit-banging device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device gpio"
.Cd "device gpioiic"
.Cd "device iic"
.Cd "device iicbb"
.Cd "device iicbus"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Em gpioiic
driver provides an IIC bit-banging interface using two GPIO pins for the
SCL and SDA on the
.Em gpiobus .
.Nm
implements an open colector kind of output, as recommended by the standard,
when driving the pins on the
.Em gpiobus ,
i.e, they are never switched to the logical value of '1',
or they are '0' or simply open (Hi-Z/tri-state).
So the pullup resistors are required so
.Nm
can work.
.Pp
On a hint based system, like
.Li MIPS , these values are configureable for the
.Nm gpioiic :
.Bl -tag -width ".Va hint.gpioiic.%d.atXXX"
.It Va hint.gpioiic.%d.at
The gpiobus you are attaching to.
Normally just gpiobus0.
.It Va hint.gpioiic.%d.pins
This is a bitmask of the pins on the
.Em gpiobus
that are to be used for SCLOCK and SDATA from the GPIO IIC
bit-banging bus.
To configure pin 0 and 7, use the bitmask of
10000001 and convert it to a hexadecimal value of 0x0081.
Please note that this mask should only ever have two bits set
(any others bits - i.e., pins - will be ignored).
.It Va hint.gpioiic.%d.scl
Indicates which bit in the
.Va hint.gpioiic.%d.pins
should be used as the SCLOCK
source.
.It Va hint.gpioiic.%d.sda
Indicates which bit in the
.Va hint.gpioiic.%d.pins
should be used as the SDATA
source.
