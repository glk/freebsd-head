.Sh NAME
.Nm oce
.Nd "Device driver for Emulex OneConnect 10Gb network adapters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device oce"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_oce_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Emulex one connect adapters come in various skews and with
different combinations of NIC, FCoE and iSCSI functions.
oce claims the NIC functions in all these adapters.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports VLAN Hardware offload, TCP checksum offload,
TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large receive offload (LRO),
Bonding, Jumbo frames (from 1500 - 9000), Multiple TX queues,
Receive-Side Scaling(RSS) and MSI-X interrupts.	
.Sh HARDWARE
.Nm
driver supports the following Emulex network adapters:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
BladeEngine 2
.It
BladeEngine 3
.It
Lancer
.El
.Sh UPDATING FIRMWARE
Adapter firmware updates are persistent.

Firmware can be updated by following the steps below:
.nf
 1) Copy the below code to a Makefile
  ".KMOD=elxflash
   FIRMWS=imagename.ufi:elxflash
   .include <bsd.kmod.mk>"
 2) Replace imagename in above with UFI file name.
 3) Copy Makefile and UFI to a directory
 4) Execute make & copy generated elxflash.ko to /lib/modules
 5) sysctl dev.oce.<if_id>.fw_upgrade=elxflash
 6) Reboot the machine.

In case of issues with supplied UFI, flashing fails with one
of the below errors.
 1) "Invalid BE3 firmware image"
 2) "Invalid Cookie. Firmware image corrupted ?"
 3) "cmd to write to flash rom failed."
