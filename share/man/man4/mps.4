.Sh NAME
.Nm mps
.Nd LSI Fusion-MPT 2 Serial Attached SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into your kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device mps"
.Ed
.Pp
Or, to load the driver as a module at boot, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mps_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for LSI Logic Fusion-MPT 2
.Tn SAS
controllers.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
LSI Logic SAS2004 (4 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2008 (8 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2108 (8 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2116 (16 Port
.Tn SAS )
.It
LSI Logic SAS2208 (8 Port
.Tn SAS )
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
To disable MSI interrupts for all
.Nm
driver instances, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.disable_msi=1
.Ed
.Pp
To disable MSI-X interrupts for all
.Nm
driver instances, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.disable_msix=1
.Ed
.Pp
To allow the driver to send multiple task management commands (like abort,
LUN reset, etc.), set the following variable:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.X.allow_multiple_tm_cmds=1
.Ed
.Pp
via
.Xr loader.conf 5
or
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
where X is the adapter number.
By default the driver only sends one task management command at a time, to
avoid causing a potential controller lock-up.
.Sh DEBUGGING
To enable debugging prints from the
.Nm
driver, set the
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.mps.X.debug_level
.Ed
.Pp
variable, where X is the adapter number, either in
.Xr loader.conf 5
or via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
The following bits have the described effects:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It 0x01
Enable informational prints.
.It 0x02
Enable tracing prints.
.It 0x04
Enable prints for driver faults.
.It 0x08
Enable prints for controller events.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was originally written by
.An Scott Long Aq scottl@FreeBSD.org .
This man page was written by
.An Ken Merry Aq ken@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
This driver is still in development, it has only been tested on the amd64
architecture and has some known shortcomings:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
No IR (Integrated RAID) support.
.It 
No userland utility support (e.g.
.Xr mptutil 8).
.It
Sometimes the driver gets into a state where devices arrive and depart multiple
times, without user intervention.
.It
The error recovery code isn't complete.
