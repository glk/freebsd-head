# Generic mechanism to deal with WITH and WITHOUT options and turn them into MK_ options.
#
#
# For each option FOO that defaults to YES, MK_FOO is set to yes, unless WITHOUT_FOO
# is defined, in which case it is set to no. If both WITH_FOO and WITHOUT_FOO are
# defined, WITHOUT_FOO wins. The list of default yes options is contained in the
# __DEFAULT_YES_OPTIONS variable, which is undefined after expansion.
#
# For each option FOO that defaults to NO, MK_FOO is set to no, unless WITH_FOO
# is defined, in which case it is set to yes. If both WITH_FOO and WITHOUT_FOO are
# defined, WITH_FOO wins. The list of default no options is contained in the
# __DEFAULT_NO_OPTIONS variable, which is undefined after expansion.
