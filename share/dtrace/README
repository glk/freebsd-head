$FreeBSD$

This directory contains scripts for use with the DTrace system.  The
toolkit/ directory installs the latest vendor import of Brendan
Gregg's DTraceToolkit while the other files and directories
contain code generated by the FreeBSD Project for use with DTrace on
FreeBSD.

NOTE: Do not add new scripts to the toolkit directory. New DTraceToolkit
scripts should be send to the maintainer of the toolkit and then brought
back into FreeBSD via future vendor imports.
