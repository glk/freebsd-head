.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl H Ar heads
.Op Fl P Ar blksz
.Op Fl S Ar secsz
.Op Fl T Ar tracksz
.Op Fl b Ar bootcode
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl y
.Fl s Ar scheme
.Fl p Ar partition
.Op Fl p Ar partition ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a disk image from the raw partition contents specified with
the
.Ar partition
argument(s) and using the partitioning scheme specified with the
.Ar scheme
argument.
The disk image is written to
.Ar stdout
by default or the file specified with the
.Ar outfile
argument.
The image file is a raw disk image by default, but the format of the
image file can be specified with the
.Ar format
argument.
.Pp
The disk image can be made bootable by specifying the scheme-specific boot
block contents with the
.Ar bootcode
argument and,
depending on the scheme,
with a boot partition.
The contents of such a boot partition is provided like any other partition
and the
.Nm
utility does not treat it any differently from other partitions.
.Pp
Some partitioning schemes need a disk geometry and for those the
.Nm
utility accepts the
.Ar tracksz
and
.Ar heads
arguments, specifying the number of sectors per track and the number of
heads per cylinder (resp.)
.Pp
Both the logical and physical sector size can be specified and for that the
.Nm
utility
accepts the
.Ar secsz
and
.Ar blksz
arguments.
The
.Ar secsz
argument is used to specify the logical sector size.
This is the sector size reported by a disk when queried for its capacity.
Modern disks use a larger sector size internally,
referred to as block size by the
.Nm
utility and this can be specified by the
.Ar blksz
argument.
The
.Nm
utility will use the (physical) block size to determine the start of
partitions and to round the size of the disk image.
.Pp
The
.Op Fl v
option increases the level of output that the
.Nm
utility prints.
.Pp
The
.Op Fl y
option is used for testing purposes only and is not to be used in production.
When present, the
.Nm
utility will generate predictable values for Universally Unique Identifiers
(UUIDs) and time stamps so that consecutive runs of the
.Nm
utility will create images that are identical.
.Pp
For a complete list of supported partitioning schemes or supported output
format, or for a detailed description of how to specify partitions, run the
.Nm
utility without any arguments.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "TMPDIR" -compact
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory to put temporary files in; default is
.Pa /tmp .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a bootable disk image that is partitioned using the GPT scheme and
containing a root file system that was previously created using
.Xr makefs
and also containing a swap partition, run the
.Nm
utility as follows:
.Dl % mkimg -s gpt -b /boot/pmbr -p freebsd-boot:=/boot/gptboot \
-p freebsd-ufs:=root-file-system.ufs -p freebsd-swap::1G \
-o gpt.img
.Pp
The command line given above results in a raw image file.
This is because no output format was given.
To create a VMDK image for example, add the
.Fl f Ar vmdk
argument to the
.Nm
utility and name the output file accordingly.
.Pp
A nested partitioning scheme is created by running the
.Nm
utility twice.
The output of the first will be fed as the contents of a partition to the
second.
This can be done using a temporary file, like so:
.Dl % mkimg -s bsd -b /boot/boot -p freebsd-ufs:=root-file-system.ufs \
-p freebsd-swap::1G -o /tmp/bsd.img
.Dl % mkimg -s mbr -b /boot/mbr -p freebsd:=/tmp/bsd.img -o mbr-bsd.img
.Pp
Alternatively, the
.Nm
utility can be run in a cascaded fashion, whereby the output of the
first is fed directly into the second.
To do this, run the
.Nm
utility as follows:
.Dl % mkimg -s mbr -b /boot/mbr -p freebsd:-'mkimg -s bsd -b /boot/boot \
-p freebsd-ufs:=root-file-system.ufs -p freebsd-swap::1G' -o mbr-bsd.img
.Pp
To accomodate the need to have partitions named or numbered in a certain
way, the
.Nm
utility allows for the specification of empty partitions.
For example, to create an image that is compatible with partition layouts
found in
.Pa /etc/disktab ,
the 'd' partition often needs to be skipped.
This is accomplished by inserting an unused partition after the first 2
partition specifications.
It is worth noting at this time that the BSD scheme will automatically
skip the 'c' partition by virtue of it referring to the entire disk.
To create an image that is compatible with the qp120at disk, use the
.Nm
utility as follows:
.Dl % mkimg -s bsd -b /boot/boot -p freebsd-ufs:=root-file-system.ufs \
-p freebsd-swap::20M -p- -p- -p- -p- -p freebsd-ufs:=usr-file-system.ufs \
-o bsd.img
.Pp
For partitioning schemes that feature partition labels, the
.Nm
utility supports assigning labels to the partitions specified.
In the following example the file system partition is labeled as 'backup':
.Dl % mkimg -s gpt -p freebsd-ufs/backup:=file-system.ufs -o gpt.img
