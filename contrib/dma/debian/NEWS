dma (0.0.2010.06.17-3) unstable; urgency=low

   The default delivery mode has been changed to immediate, as it is in
   the upstream version of dma; the DEFER keyword is now disabled by default
   in dma.conf.

dma (0.0.2010.06.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

   The dma spool directory format has changed.  The Debian package of dma now
   recommends a separate package containing the dma-migrate utility; if it is
   present, it will be invoked at each periodic dma queue flush and attempt to
   convert the existing old-style queued messages to the new format.  In most
   cases, this should not incur any performance penalties in normal operation,
   since dma-migrate will scan the spool directory and ignore any new messages
   (they should already be in the new format); however, if it appears that
   the periodic queue flush runs take longer than usual to start up, you may
   remove the dma-migrate package once you have ascertained that your queue
   directory (/var/spool/dma) only contains files with names beginning with
   the letters M or Q.

   This version of dma knows how to perform MX lookups, so remote delivery is
   now possible directly, not through a smarthost.  However, a smarthost setup
   might still be preferred on many systems for various reasons - e.g. dynamic
   address assignment, a central outgoing mailserver, a roaming laptop, etc.
