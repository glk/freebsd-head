dma (0.0.2010.06.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - no longer reports the remote port number; Closes: #544820
    - fixes some queue locking problems; Closes: #582593
    - adapt the rules file to use the GNU Makefile instead of the BSD one
    - drop pmake from Build-Depends
    - remove the 01-debian-build patch, overtaken by upstream changes
    - in the 03-debian-locations patch, make the Debian defaults actual
      defaults for the dma binary, not just in the dma.conf file
    - adapt the 04-debian-setgid patch for the GNU Makefile
    - in the 10-liblockfile patch, change the GNU Makefile, too
    - enhance the 11-double-bounce patch a bit:
      - use dma's own delqueue() function instead of a naive unlink() so
        all the queue files are cleaned up
      - document the Debian default for DBOUNCEPROG in the manual page
    - resurrect the 13-hardening patch, correcting a couple of
      unchecked asprintf(3) and vasprintf(3) invocations
    - the functionality of the 20-parse-recipient patch was implemented
      upstream in a different way, so replace it with a small bugfix
    - remove the 22-openfiles patch, overtaken by upstream changes
    - in the 24-random-message-id patch, change the GNU Makefile, too
    - add the 27-int-size patch to cast a variable to the correct type
    - add the 28-valid-recipient patch to fix parsing recipients out of
      the message body
    - add the 29-double-free patch to fix a double-free error
    - add the 30-ldflags patch to honor LDFLAGS if specified
    - refresh the 09-typos, 17-mailname, 23-dirent-d_type, and
      25-unsupported-starttls patches
    - teach the dbounce-simple-safecat handler about the M*/Q* spool
      files scheme
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.0 with no changes.
  * Update the copyright file:
    - bring it up to the latest revision of the DEP 5
    - update the upstream copyright notices
    - bump the year on my copyright notice
  * Remove the diffsrc rules target which was intended for my own
    internal use, but has outlived its time.
  * Use dpkg-buildflags from dpkg-dev >= 1.15.7~ to get the default
    values for CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS; no longer rely on
    dpkg-buildpackage to set them by default.
  * Add the dma-migrate utility (in a separate binary package) to convert
    spool files to the new queue format (M* and Q* files for each message)
  * Add a dma-migrate invocation to dma.cron.d
  * Shorten the Vcs-Browser URL.
  * Add the 31-sigalrm-backoff patch to force a delivery attempt on SIGALRM.
  * Properly substitute the debconf-supplied values for DBOUNCEPROG and
    SMARTHOST into dma.conf even if they are empty without generating
    an invalid dma.conf file.
  * Remove the smarthost default; dma does MX lookups now, so it doesn't
    really *need* one anymore.
  * Reword the debconf relayhost question - dma does not really need
    a smarthost anymore.
  * Update the debconf translations:
    - Bulgarian
    - Portuguese by Am√©rico Monteiro
    - German by Helge Kreutzmann; Closes: #586531
    - Russian by Yuri Kozlov; Closes: #586579
    - Czech by Michal Simunek; Closes: #586791
    - Swedish by Martin Bagge; Closes: #586825
    - Spanish by Francisco Javier Cuadrado; Closes: #587088
  * Update the smarthost configuration information in README.Debian.
  * Add the 32-comment-uncomment patch to correct the manual page wording.
  * Add the 33-opportunistic-tls patch to allow remote connections to proceed
    even if the STARTTLS negotiation fails.
  * Fix the 25-unsupported-starttls patch to actually error out if the SSL
    negotiation fails.
  * Forward all the non-Debian-specific patches upstream to Simon Schubert.
  * Add the 34-manpage-defaults patch to properly document what dma will use
    as default values if not specified in the config file instead of what
    the default config file specifies.  Closes: #544748
  * Add the 35-delivery-retry patch to try local deliveries a bit more often
    and to randomize the delivery timeout to avoid locking issues.

dma (0.0.2009.07.17-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really install the files in /etc/dma/ as root/mail/640 and
    change the ownership of the existing files in the postinst script
    when upgrading from older versions.  Closes: #544664
  * Install the /usr/bin/mailq and /usr/bin/newaliases symlinks.
    Closes: #558421
  * Switch to the 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  * Update the debconf translations:
    - add German.  Closes: #552754
    - add Japanese.  Closes: #554515
    - remove a double space and unfuzzy the translations.  Closes: #552586
  * Fix a crash when the SMTP server does not support STARTTLS.
    Closes: #547594
  * Always use the user-supplied value from the debconf query for
    the smarthost and the double-bounce program.  This may result in
    debconf overriding a manually-edited config file, so add a note to
    dma.conf stating that these values are handled via debconf.
    Closes: #544663
  * Fix a misspelling of dma/dbounceprog as dma/defer in the debconf
    configuration script.  Oops.

dma (0.0.2009.07.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow the spool directory to live on a filesystem that does not

    Closes: #544357
  * Randomize the Message-Id a bit more.  Closes: #544475

  * Only enable the build hardening wrapper if the "hardening" build
    option is specified.
  * Switch the copyright file header from the Wiki to DEP 5.

    knows about the .Dx mdoc macro.  Add a lintian override for
    the "Unknown DragonFly version" error.
