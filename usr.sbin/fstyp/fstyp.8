.Nm fstyp
.Nd determine filesystem type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl s
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to determine the filesystem type on a given device.
It can recognize ISO-9660, Ext2, FAT, NTFS, and UFS filesystems.
The filesystem name is printed to the standard output
as, respectively,
.Li cd9660 ,
.Li ext2fs ,
.Li msdosfs ,
.Li ntfs ,
or
.Li ufs .
.Pp
Because
.Nm
is built specifically to detect filesystem types, it differs from
.Xr file 1
in several ways.
The output is machine-parsable, filesystem labels are supported,
and only filesystems are identified.
Security is improved with
.Xr capsicum 4 .
.Pp
These options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl l"
.It Fl l
In addition to filesystem type, print filesystem label if available.
.It Fl s
Ignore file type.
By default,
.Nm
only works on regular files and disk-like device nodes.
Trying to read other file types might have unexpected consequences or hang
indefinitely.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs or the filesystem
type is not recognized.
