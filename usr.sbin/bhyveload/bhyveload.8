.Sh NAME
.Nm bhyveload
.Nd load a
.Fx
guest inside a bhyve virtual machine
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl m Ar lowmem
.Op Fl M Ar highmem
.Op Fl d Ar disk-path
.Op Fl h Ar host-path
.Ar vmname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to load a
.Fx
guest inside a
.Xr bhyve 4
virtual machine.
.Pp
.Nm
is based on
.Xr loader 8
and will present an interface identical to the
.Fx
loader on the user's terminal.
.Pp
The virtual machine is identified as
.Ar vmname
and will be created if it does not already exist.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl m Ar lowmem
.Ar lowmem
is the amount of memory allocated below 4GB in the guest's physical address
space.
.Pp
The default value of
.Ar lowmem
is 256MB.
.It Fl M Ar highmem
.Ar highmem
is the amount of memory allocated above 4GB in the guest's physical address
space.
.Pp
The default value of
.Ar highmem
is 0MB.
.It Fl d Ar disk-path
The
.Ar disk-path
is the pathname of the guest's boot disk image.
.It Fl h Ar host-path
The
.Ar host-path
is the directory at the top of the guest's boot filesystem.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a virtual machine named
.Ar freebsd-vm
that boots off the ISO image
.Pa /freebsd/release.iso
and has 1GB memory allocated to it:
.Pp
.Dl "bhyveload -m 256 -M 768 -d /freebsd/release.iso freebsd-vm"
.Pp
In the example above the 1GB allocation is split in two segments:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
256MB below the 4GB boundary (0MB - 256MB)
.It
768MB above the 4GB boundary (4096MB - 4864MB)
