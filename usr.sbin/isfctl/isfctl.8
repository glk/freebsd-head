.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar device
.Ic erase
.Ar offset
.Ar size
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a way for administrators to control aspects of
.Xr isf 4
devices that can not be managed though the
.Xr disk 9
interface.
.Pp
The

.Ar offset
covering a total of
.Ar size
bytes.
The
.Ar offset
argument must be a multiple of 128K.
The
.Ar size
argument must either be a multiple of 128K or a number less than 32K in
which case it is treated as a number of 128K blocks to erase.
.El
