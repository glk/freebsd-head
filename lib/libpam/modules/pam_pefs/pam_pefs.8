.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_pefs
.Nd pefs PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_ssh
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
pefs
authentication service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for two PAM categories:
authentication
and session management.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, they are the
.Dq Li auth
and
.Dq Li session
features.
.Pp
Module expects pefs file system to be mounted on user home directory
and fails otherwise.
.Ss Pefs Authentication Module
The
pefs
authentication component
provides a function to verify the identity of a user
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
by prompting the user for a passphrase and verifying that it exists in
pefs key chain database.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm use_first_pass"
.It Cm use_first_pass
If the authentication module
is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module
obtained the user's password,
that password is used
to authenticate the user.
If this fails,
the authentication module returns failure
without prompting the user for a password.
This option has no effect
if the authentication module
is the first in the stack,
or if no previous modules
obtained the user's password.
.It Cm try_first_pass
This option is similar to the
.Cm use_first_pass
option,
except that if the previously obtained password fails,
the user is prompted for another password.
.It Cm ignore_missing
Accept any passphrase provided by the user.
This option is used not to authenticate user, but to preserve keys that
should be added to pefs file system by session management module.
Option is incompatible with
.Cm try_first_pass
option and should be used with
.Cm use_first_pass
option.
.El
.Ss Pefs Session Management Module
The
pefs
session management component
provides functions to initiate
.Pq Fn pam_sm_open_session
and terminate
.Pq Fn pam_sm_close_session
sessions.
The
.Fn pam_sm_open_session
function adds key or key chain decrypted during the authentication phase
to the pefs file system mounted on user home directory.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa $HOME/.pefs.conf" -compact
.It Pa $HOME/.pefs.conf
pefs configuration file
.It Pa $HOME/.pefs.db
pefs key chain database file
