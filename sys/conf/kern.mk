# On i386, do not align the stack to 16-byte boundaries.  Otherwise GCC 2.95

# stack to 16-byte boundaries -- thus wasting approximately 12 bytes of stack
# per function call.  While the 16-byte alignment may benefit micro benchmarks,
# it is probably an overall loss as it makes the code bigger (less efficient
# use of code cache tag lines) and uses more stack (less efficient use of data
# cache tag lines).  Explicitly prohibit the use of FPU, SSE and other SIMD
# operations inside the kernel itself.  These operations are exclusively
