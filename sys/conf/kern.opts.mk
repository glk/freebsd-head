# Options set in the build system that affect the kernel somehow.

#
# Define MK_* variables (which are either "yes" or "no") for users
# to set via WITH_*/WITHOUT_* in /etc/src.conf and override in the
# make(1) environment.
# These should be tested with `== "no"' or `!= "no"' in makefiles.
# The NO_* variables should only be set by makefiles for variables
# that haven't been converted over.
#

# These options are used by the kernel build process (kern.mk and kmod.mk)
# They have to be listed here so we can build modules outside of the
# src tree.
