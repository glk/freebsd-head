  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 xml:id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para/>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="amd64">The maximum amount of memory the &os; kernel
      can address has been increased from 1TB to 4TB.</para>

    <para>A new &man.cpuset.2; API has been added
      for thread to CPU binding and CPU resource grouping and
      assignment.  The &man.cpuset.1; userland utility has been added
      to allow manipulation of processor sets.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.ddb.4; kernel debugger now has an output capture
      facility.  Input and output from &man.ddb.4; can now be captured
      to a memory buffer for later inspection using &man.sysctl.8; or
      a textdump.  The new <command>capture</command> command controls
      this feature.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports a simple scripting
      facility, which supports a set of named scripts consisting of a
      set of &man.ddb.4; commands.  These commands can be managed from
      within &man.ddb.4; or with the use of the new &man.ddb.8;
      utility.  More details can be found in the &man.ddb.4; manual
      page.</para>

    <para role="merged">The kernel now supports a new textdump format of kernel
      dumps.  A textdump provides higher-level information via
      mechanically generated/extracted debugging output, rather than a
      simple memory dump.  This facility can be used to generate brief
      kernel bug reports that are rich in debugging information, but
      are not dependent on kernel symbol tables or precisely
      synchronized source code.  More information can be found in the
      &man.textdump.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>Kernel support for M:N threading has been removed.  While
      the KSE (Kernel Scheduled Entities) project was quite successful
      in bringing threading to FreeBSD, the M:N approach taken by the
      KSE library was never developed to its full potential.
      Backwards compatibility for applications using KSE threading
      will be provided via &man.libmap.conf.5; for dynamically linked
      binaries.  The &os; Project greatly appreciates the work of
      &a.julian;, &a.deischen;, and &a.davidxu; on KSE support.</para>

    <para>The &os; kernel now exports information about certain kernel
      features via the <varname>kern.features</varname> sysctl tree.
      The &man.feature.present.3; library call provides a convenient
      interface for user applications to test the presence of
      features.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">The &os; kernel now has support for large
      memory page mappings (<quote>superpages</quote>).</para>

    <para arch="amd64,i386,ia64,powerpc" role="merged">The ULE
      scheduler is now the default process scheduler
      in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernels.</para>

    <sect3 xml:id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">The BTX kernel used by the boot
	loader has been changed to invoke BIOS routines from real
	mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	devices.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">A new gptboot boot loader has
        been added to support booting from a GPT labeled disk.  A
        new <command>boot</command> command has been added to
        &man.gpt.8;, which makes a GPT disk bootable by writing the
        required bits of the boot loader, creating a new boot
        partition if required.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 xml:id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para role="merged">The &man.cmx.4; driver, a driver for Omnikey CardMan 4040
        PCMCIA smartcard readers, has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.syscons.4; driver now supports Colemak keyboard layout.</para>

      <para role="merged">The &man.uslcom.4; driver, a driver for Silicon
        Laboratories CP2101/CP2102-based USB serial adapters, has been
        imported from OpenBSD.</para>

      <sect4 xml:id="mm">
	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

        <para>Support for version 2.0 of the USB Audio reference design
          has been added. New devices should support higher bandwidth,
          increased sampling frequency and wider dynamic range.</para>

      </sect4>

      <sect4 xml:id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	<para>The &man.ale.4; driver has been added to provide support
	  for Atheros AR8121/AR8113/AR8114 Gigabit/Fast Ethernet controllers.</para>

	<para>The &man.em.4; driver has been split into two drivers
	  with some common parts.  The &man.em.4; driver will continue
	  to support adapters up to the 82575, as well as new
	  client/desktop adapters.  A new &man.igb.4; driver
	  will support new server adapters.</para>

	<para>The &man.jme.4; driver has been added to provide support
	  for PCIe network adapters based on JMicron JMC250 Gigabit
	  Ethernet and JMC260 Fast Ethernet controllers.</para>

	  performance and to add support for checksum offloading.  It
	  should also work on all architectures.</para>

	<para>The &man.re.4; driver has been overhauled to fix a
	  number of issues.  This driver now has Wake On LAN (WOL)
	  support.</para>

	<para>The &man.vr.4; driver has been overhauled to fix a
	  number of outstanding issues.  It also now works on all
	  architectures.</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">The &man.wpi.4; driver has
	  been updated to include a number of stability fixes.</para>

      </sect4>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 xml:id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>&man.carp.4; has been rewritten to make addresses
        more sane from the viewpoint of routing daemons such as
        quagga/zebra. It also brings support for a single redundant
        address on the subnet (carpdev), switching state with
        ifconfig, better locking and using modern kernel
        interfaces to allocate multicast memberships.</para>

      <para>The &man.pf.4; firewall now supports fine-grain locking
        and better utilization on multi-cpu machines resulting in
        significant improvements in performance.</para>

      <para>Support for up to 65536 routing tables has been
        introduced.</para>

      <para>Support for setting/matching differentiated services
        codepoints (DSCP) in IP header has been added to

    </sect3>

    <sect3 xml:id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para role="merged">The &man.aac.4; driver now supports volumes larger than
        2TB in size.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports a spindown command for
        disks; after a configurable amount of time, if no requests
        have been received for a disk, the disk will be spun down
        until the next request.  The &man.atacontrol.8; utility now
        supports a <command>spindown</command> command to configure
        this feature.</para>

      <para role="merged">The &man.hptrr.4; driver has been updated to version 1.2
        from Highpoint.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 xml:id="fs">
      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>A new kernel-based iSCSI target and initiator has been
        added</para>

      <para>UFS filesystems can now be enlarged with &man.growfs.8; while
        mounted read-write. This is especially useful for virtual
        machines, allowing the addition of more harddrive space without
        interruption of service.</para>

      <para>A state of the art FUSE implementation is now part of the
        base system. It allows the use of nearly all fusefs file
        systems</para>

      <para>Support for the high performance LZ4 compression algorithm
        has been added to ZFS. LZ4 is usually faster and can achieve a
        higher compression ratio than LZJB, the default compression
        algorithm</para>

      <para>Support for L2ARC compression has been added to ZFS.</para>

      <para>ZFS will now compare the checksums of incoming writes to
        the checksum of the existing on-disk data and avoid issuing any
        write I/O for data that has not changed. This will reduce I/O
        as well as space usage because if the old block is referenced
        by a snapshot, both copies of the block are kept even though
        both contain the same data.</para>

    </sect3>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para role="merged">The &man.adduser.8; utility now supports

      with the same semantics as (for example)
      &man.chmod.1;.</para>

    <para>For compatibility with other implementations, &man.cp.1; now
      supports a <option>-a</option> flag, which is equivalent to
      specifying the <option>-RrP</option> flags.</para>

    <para>BSD-licensed version of &man.cpio.1; based on
