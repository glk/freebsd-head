	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

  <abstract>
    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
      containing significant information discovered after the release
      or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
      release documentation.
      This information includes security advisories, as well as news
      relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
      operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
      should always be consulted before installing this version of
      &os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document for &os; &release;
      will be maintained until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release;
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>
