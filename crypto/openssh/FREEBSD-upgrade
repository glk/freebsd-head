	    FreeBSD maintainer's guide to OpenSSH-portable
	    ==============================================

00) Make sure your mail spool has plenty of free space.  It'll fill up
    pretty fast once you're done with this checklist.

01) Download the latest OpenSSH-portable tarball and signature from
    OpenBSD (ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/).

02) Verify the signature:

    $ gpg --verify openssh-X.YpZ.tar.gz.asc

03) Unpack the tarball in a suitable directory:

    $ tar xf openssh-X.YpZ.tar.gz

04) Copy to the vendor directory:

    $ svn co svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor-crypto/openssh/dist
    $ rsync --archive --delete openssh-X.YpZ/ dist/

05) Take care of added / deleted files:

    $ svn rm $(svn stat dist | awk '$1 == "!" { print $2 }')
    $ svn add --no-auto-props $(svn stat dist | awk '$1 == "?" { print $2 }')

06) Commit:

    $ svn commit -m "Vendor import of OpenSSH X.YpZ." dist

07) Tag:

    $ svn copy -m "Tag OpenSSH X.YpZ." \
        svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor-crypto/openssh/dist \
        svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor-crypto/openssh/X.YpZ

08) Check out head and run the pre-merge script:

    $ svn co svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/head
    $ cd head/crypto/openssh
    $ sh freebsd-pre-merge.sh

09) Merge from the vendor branch:

    $ svn merge -cNNNNNN \^/vendor-crypto/openssh/dist .

0A) Resolve conflicts.  Remember to bump the version addendum in
    version.h, and update the default value in ssh{,d}_config and
    ssh{,d}_config.5.

0B) Diff against the vendor branch:

    $ svn diff \^/vendor-crypto/openssh/dist .

    Files that have modifications relative to the vendor code, and
    only those files, must have the svn:keywords property set to
    FreeBSD=%H and be listed in the 'keywords' file created by the
    pre-merge script.

0C) Run the post-merge script:

    $ sh freebsd-post-merge.sh

0D) Run the configure script:

    $ sh freebsd-configure.sh

0E) Check config.h very carefully.

0F) If source files have been added or removed, update the appropriate
    makefiles to reflect changes in the vendor's Makefile.in.

10) Build libssh:

    $ cd ../../secure/lib/libssh && make obj && make depend && make

11) Follow the instructions in ssh_namespace.h to get a list of new
    symbols, and them to ssh_namespace.h.  Keep it sorted!

12) Build and install world, reboot, test.  Pay particular attention
    to pam_ssh(8), which gropes inside libssh and will break if
    something significant changes or if ssh_namespace.h is out of
    whack.

13) Commit, and hunker down for the inevitable storm of complaints.



	  An overview of FreeBSD changes to OpenSSH-portable
	  ==================================================

XXX This section is out of date

0) VersionAddendum

   The SSH protocol allows for a human-readable version string of up
   to 40 characters to be appended to the protocol version string.
   FreeBSD takes advantage of this to include a date indicating the
   "patch level", so people can easily determine whether their system
   is vulnerable when an OpenSSH advisory goes out.  Some people,
   however, dislike advertising their patch level in the protocol
   handshake, so we've added a VersionAddendum configuration variable
   to allow them to change or disable it.

1) Modified server-side defaults

   We've modified some configuration defaults in sshd:

      - PasswordAuthentication defaults to "no".

      - LoginGraceTime defaults to 120 seconds instead of 600.

      - PermitRootLogin defaults to "no".

      - X11Forwarding defaults to "yes" (it's a threat to the client,
        not to the server.)

2) Modified client-side defaults

   We've modified some configuration defaults in ssh:

      - CheckHostIP defaults to "no".

3) Canonic host names

   We've added code to ssh.c to canonicize the target host name after
   reading options but before trying to connect.  This eliminates the
   usual problem with duplicate known_hosts entries.

4) setusercontext() environment

   Our setusercontext(3) can set environment variables, which we must
   take care to transfer to the child's environment.
